k8s-deployment
==============

This repository contains a canonical Kubernetes cluster, as
deployed by the [k8s-boshrelease][1].  It provides a good starter
deployment, as well as operations files for adding new features,
scaling / renaming / resizing the cluster, and more.

To use this deployment, you will need a BOSH director, the
deployment of which is beyond the scope of this README and this
project.
