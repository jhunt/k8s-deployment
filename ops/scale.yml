#  ops/scale.yml
#
#  Out of the box, this deployment gives you a single control
#  plane node (etcd + apiserver) and three worker nodes.
#
#  This ops file lets you scale those two instance groups
#  independently.  Best practices dictate that control nodes
#  always be deployed in odd numbers (usually 1, 3, or 5).
#  Worker nodes should be scaled to meet your workload demands.
