#  ops/latest-release.yml
#
#  This deployment recipe is pinned to a specific version of the
#  k8s BOSH release.  If, for whatever reason, you want or need to
#  use a newer version of the release, this ops file lets you pin
#  to the "latest" available on the BOSH director you are deploying
#  this cluster to.
#
#  Note that other issues with the manifest may crop up if your
#  targeted release version is too far in the past or the future.
