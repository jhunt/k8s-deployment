#  ops/vip.yml
#
#  This ops file co-locates a new load balancer job ("lb") on the control
#  node, and activates the keepalived VRRP feature to enable a single
#  entrypoint to a cluster of API server nodes.  For this to work, you
#  must choose a virtual router ID that is not in use on the local LAN,
#  as well as a virtual IP (the "VIP") to be the singular entrypoint.
#
#  These are specified as the "vrrp_id" and "vip" variables, respesctively.
