#  ops/latest-stemcell.yml
#
#  This deployment recipe is pinned to a specific version of Xenial
#  Ubuntu stemcell.  If, for whatever reason, you want or need to
#  use a newer version of the stemell, this ops file lets you pin
#  to the "latest" available on the BOSH director you are deploying
#  this cluster to.
